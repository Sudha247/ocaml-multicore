(* [update_to_forcing blk] expects [blk] to be a lazy value with one of the
 * tags -- [Obj.lazy_tag], [Obj.forward_tag], [Obj.forcing_tag] -- or a
 * short-circuited lazy object. This function is implemented in C due to the
 * atomicity requirements wrt the GC.
 *
 * If [blk] happens to be a lazy value with [Obj.lazy_tag], the tag is changed
 * to [Obj.forcing_tag] using compare-and-swap taking care to handle concurrent
 * marking of the header word by a concurrent GC thread. Returns [0] in this
 * case.
 *
 * If [blk] happens to be [Obj.forcing_tag] and the domain that earlier forced
 * this lazy is the current domain, then returns [1]. This condition indicates
 * recursive forcing of this lazy value.
 *
 * If [blk] happens to be [Obj.forcing_tag] and the domain that earlier forced
 * this lazy is a different domain, then returns [2]. This condition indicates
 * a race on forcing this lazy value.
 *
 * If [blk] happens to be [Obj.forward_tag], then returns [3].
 *
 * If [blk] happens to have any other tag or is a primitive value, then returns
 * [4].
